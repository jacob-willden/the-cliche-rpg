# The Clich√© RPG
[Source Code Location](https://github.com/jacob-willden/the-cliche-rpg)

This is a work in progress demo for a role-playing game (RPG) engine, with some clean, subpar humor mixed in. It's built using React, a JavaScript library. I'm aiming to make it as accessible as possible, whether with a keyboard, touch screen, mouse, trackpad, or any assistive technology that can be used to access the Web. All the same, my resources are limited and there's always something I might miss, so I'm completely open to any changes that will make this project more accessible (and this applies to any of my projects).

Note: The HTML utilizes the `dialog` element, which has only seen wide support in the past couple of years (see [dialog element support on "Can I Use"](https://caniuse.com/?search=dialog)), so testing will be needed in order to know how legacy software responds to the markup.

You can either [play the game on a live site](https://the-cliche-rpg.vercel.app/), or host it yourself using the following installation instructions.

## Installation Instructions
1. Install [NPM](https://nodejs.org/en/download), if you don't already have it installed
2. Download the repository and extract the ZIP file
3. Using a command line program (like the Windows Subsystem for Linux on Windows, or Terminal on Mac), change the directory into the extracted folder (e.g. `cd ~/Downloads/the-cliche-rpg/`)
4. Run `npm install` to install dependencies
5. Run `npm run dev` to start the server with the game on it

You can stop the server by either using a keyboard shortcut to cancel the run command (e.g. <kbd>Control</kbd>+<kbd>C</kbd>), or by quitting the command line program.

## Todos
- Fix audio issues
- Add assistive technology testing results
